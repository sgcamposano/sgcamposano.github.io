            <p class="card-text"><strong>Notre-Dame de Paris</strong>, which means <strong>"Our Lady of Paris" in French</strong>, is one of the most famous cathedrals in the world.
              Located on the <strong>Île de la Cité</strong>,  a small island in the Seine River, it is a masterpiece of <strong>Gothic architecture and a symbol of Paris</strong>.
              <br><br>Construction started in <strong>1163</strong> under <strong>Bishop Maurice de Sully</strong> and took over <strong>180 years to complete</strong>, finishing in <strong>1345.</strong>
              The cathedral is known for its beautiful rose windows, flying buttresses, twin towers, and gargoyles. 
              The architecture was revolutionary at the time, with high vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows that filled the church with colorful light.
              <br><br><strong>Notre-Dame</strong> has witnessed centuries of history. It was the site of <strong>Napoleon’s coronation in 1804</strong> and the beatification of <strong>Joan of Arc</strong>. 
              In modern times, it became even more famous thanks to <strong>Victor Hugo’s novel "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" (1831)</strong>, which helped spark interest in preserving the building.</p>
